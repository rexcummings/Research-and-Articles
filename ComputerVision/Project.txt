Looking at Computer Vision books and project ideas to pursue.  

Current thought process:

Create a CV project involving Human-Computer interaction using specific tools. 

Setup:
- Linux Mint 17.3 Rosa
- Kinect Depth Sensor (from Xbox 360 Kinect)
- OpenNI 2.2.0.33 Beta (x64) ~ http://openni.ru/openni-sdk/
- NiTE-Linux-x64-2.2.tar ~ https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3e4...
- OpenCV (Not sure which version yet ... probably 2.4.6)

May need:
- OpenNI2-FreenectDriver ~ https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/tree/master/OpenNI2-FreenectDriver

Info:
OpenNI2-FreenectDriver
======================

OpenNI2-FreenectDriver is a bridge to libfreenect implemented as an OpenNI2 driver.
It allows OpenNI2 to use Kinect hardware on Linux and OSX.
OpenNI2-FreenectDriver is distributed under the [Apache 2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/blob/master/APACHE20) license.

Install
-------
1. Download and unpack [OpenNI](http://structure.io/openni) 2.2.0.33 or higher.
2. Go to the top libfreenect directory and build it with the OpenNI2 driver.

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -DBUILD_OPENNI2_DRIVER=ON
        make

3. Copy the driver to your OpenNI2 driver repository. You must first change `Repository` to match your project layout.

        Repository="/example/path/to/Samples/Bin/OpenNI2/Drivers/"
        cp -L lib/OpenNI2-FreenectDriver/libFreenectDriver.{so,dylib} ${Repository}
        
        # you could instead make a symlink to avoid copying after every build
        # ln -s lib/OpenNI2-FreenectDriver/libFreenectDriver.{so,dylib} ${Repository}

OpenNI2-FreenectDriver is built with a static libfreenect, so you do not need to include libfreenect when deploying.
However, you will need to make sure target systems have libusb and all other dependencies listed in `ldd libFreenectDriver.so`.
